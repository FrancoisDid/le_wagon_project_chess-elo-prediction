## Predict elo scores of 2 players in a given chess game

The objective of the project was to be able to predict the elo scores of white and black players in a unique chess game.

Not all games are played at the same level and players often think they play well in a game or not. Tools already exist but unfortunately they are related to a platform or website such as chess.com.

Here the goal was to be evaluate any type of game with the same methodology and be able to compare and evaluate progress over time.
